##### Instructions for use:

1. Download "demo\_data" from: https://doi.org/10.26300/7sg5-w257
2. Place the demo\_data folder inside the "cablam\_in\_vivo\_analysis" folder
3. Open the script "run\_all\_in\_vivo.m" in MATLAB
4. Set the variable "pth" to the location of the cablam\_in\_vivo\_analysis folder on your computer e.g., *pth = 'C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\';*
5. Run "run\_all\_in\_vivo.m" and it will make several figures and print statistics in the Command Window
